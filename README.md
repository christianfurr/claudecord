## Features

- 🧵 **Forum-native sessions** — Discord's *New Post* button is the whole UX. The post
  title names the session, your first message is the first prompt, and the post keeps
  full conversation context for as long as it lives.
- 💭 **Live activity stream** — Claude's thinking summaries and every tool call
  (`⏺ Bash · npm test`, `⏺ Edit · auth.ts`) appear in the post as a quoted feed that
  updates in place while it works.
- 🤔→✅ **Reaction acks, zero clutter** — your message gets 🤔 while Claude works and
  ✅ when the turn lands (❌ on failure). No "message received" spam.
- 🏷️ **Session tags** — posts carry 🟢 Active / ✅ Done forum tags, so the channel
  doubles as a session dashboard.
- ♻️ **Revival** — posting in an ended or archived session brings it back with its
  memory intact (sessions resume by SDK session id).
- 🖼️ **Images** — attach screenshots or photos to any message; they're passed to
  Claude inline.
- 📊 **Live session dashboard** — an embed in every post that updates after each
  turn: model, running cost, context meter (▰▰▰▱ %), turns, and time worked.
  `/model` switches models mid-session without losing context.
- 🪶 **One process** — discord.js + the Claude Agent SDK. No tmux, no HTTP relay,
  no shell hooks, nothing to babysit.

## Quick start

### 1. Create the Discord bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → **New Application**.
2. Under **Bot**, enable the **Message Content Intent** (required — the bot reads your posts).
3. Under **OAuth2**, copy your **Client ID**, then invite the bot with this URL
   (it pre-selects the exact permissions claudecord needs):

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=292057860176
```

<details>
<summary>What those permissions are</summary>

Manage Channels (creates the forum during <code>/setup</code>), Manage Threads (tags &
archives posts), Send Messages, Send Messages in Threads, Add Reactions, Embed Links,
Read Message History.

</details>

### 2. Install and run

Requires [**Bun**](https://bun.sh) (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`) and a
machine where the [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI is logged in —
claudecord rides your existing Claude subscription. (Alternatively, set
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/christianfurr/claudecord.git
cd claudecord
bun install
bun link             # puts the `claudecord` command on your PATH

# Put your bot token in a .env file (Bun loads it automatically):
echo "DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token" > .env

claudecord install   # installs + starts the macOS daemon (launchd)
claudecord status
```

Prefer to run it in the foreground instead of as a daemon? `bun start` (or
`bun dev` for auto-restart on changes).

### The `claudecord` CLI

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `claudecord install` | Write the LaunchAgent (token embedded, `0600`) and start it — runs at login, auto-restarts on crash |
| `claudecord status` | Daemon state + pid, session counts, recent log |
| `claudecord start` / `stop` / `restart` | Control the daemon |
| `claudecord logs` | Tail the logs (`~/.claudecord/logs/`) |
| `claudecord run` | Run in the foreground (no daemon) |
| `claudecord owner [id]` | Show or set the master user — the only way to change ownership |
| `claudecord uninstall` | Remove the daemon (repo and config untouched) |

### Menu bar (optional)

A [SwiftBar](https://swiftbar.app)/xbar plugin ships in `extras/`: a 🤖 in your menu
bar (with the active-session count), green/red status, and Start/Stop/Restart/logs
one click away.

```bash
brew install swiftbar   # or xbar
ln -s "$(pwd)/extras/claudecord.5s.sh" "$HOME/Library/Application Support/SwiftBar/Plugins/"
```

You should see:

```
claudecord ready as your-bot#1234
registered 5 slash commands in 1 guild(s)
```

### 3. Set up the forum

In your server, run **`/setup`**. That creates a **#claude-sessions** forum channel
with 🟢 Active / ✅ Done tags and wires the bot to it. Done.

## Usage

**Start a session:** open **#claude-sessions** → **New Post** → title it
("fix the login bug", "research SaaS pricing") → describe what you want.

```
📋 #claude-sessions
 ├─ 🟢 fix the login bug           ← Claude is working in here
 ├─ 🟢 research SaaS pricing
 └─ ✅ set up CI                   ← done & archived
```

Inside a post you'll see something like:

> ⏺ **Grep** · loginHandler<br/>
> 💭 The token check happens before the session refresh — that ordering is the bug…<br/>
> ⏺ **Read** · auth.ts<br/>
> ⏺ **Edit** · auth.ts<br/>
> ⏺ **Bash** · run the auth test suite

…followed by Claude's actual reply as normal messages. Keep talking in the post —
it remembers everything. Sessions survive bot restarts and can be picked up days later.

## Commands

| Command | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/setup` | anywhere | One-time: creates the forum + tags, saves the config, and claims bot ownership |
| `/allow user: [action:]` | anywhere | Owner only: add/remove someone from the allowlist |
| `/new prompt: [title:]` | anywhere | Start a session without leaving the keyboard — creates the titled post and sends the prompt |
| `/status` | anywhere | Every session with live/working/dormant state, uptime, model |
| `/open` | in a post | Pop the session open in Ghostty on the host Mac (`claude --resume`) |
| `/model model:` | in a post | Switch the session's model live (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, Fable, or default) |
| `/clear` | in a post | Wipe the session's memory — fresh start, same post |
| `/end` | in a post | End the session, tag it ✅ Done, archive the post |
| `/rename title:` | in a post | Rename the post (and the session) |

## Continue a terminal session in Discord

Hand off a Claude Code session running in your terminal to Discord — useful when you
need to leave your machine mid-task.

**One-time setup** — register claudecord's MCP server so every terminal session can reach it:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user claudecord -- claudecord mcp
```

(If `claudecord` isn't on your `PATH`, use the absolute form:
`claude mcp add --scope user claudecord -- bun /path/to/claudecord/src/cli.ts mcp`.)

**Usage** — in any terminal `claude` session, ask Claude to hand off (it calls the
`handoff_to_discord` tool). A new forum post appears in your claudecord channel that
continues the same conversation. Send a message there to pick up where you left off.

The handoff is a one-way baton pass: it forks a new session id from your terminal
session's history, so the Discord side and your (now-abandoned) terminal session never
write to the same file. The bot must be running (`claudecord status`); a handoff fired
while it's down is processed when it next starts.

## Configuration

Settings live in `~/.claudecord/config.json` (created by `/setup`):

```jsonc
{
  "forumChannelId": "…",        // set by /setup
  "tagActiveId": "…",           // set by /setup
  "tagDoneId": "…",             // set by /setup
  "workDir": "/Users/you/Code", // directory Claude sessions operate in
  "model": "claude-opus-4-8",   // optional — omit to use your Claude Code default
  "terminal": "Ghostty"         // app /open uses ("Ghostty", "Terminal", …)
}
```

The session registry (session numbers, SDK session ids, status) is in
`~/.claudecord/sessions.json`.

### Access control

Only the **owner** and allowlisted users can talk to the bot — everyone else's
messages get a 🔒 and are ignored.

- The owner is whoever runs `/setup` first, and can only be changed from the host
  machine: `claudecord owner <discord-user-id>`. No Discord command can take it.
- The owner grants access with `/allow user:@friend` (and revokes with
  `action: remove`). The allowlist lives in `~/.claudecord/config.json`.

> [!WARNING]
> Sessions run with **permissions bypassed** — the SDK equivalent of
> `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`. Claude can read, write, and execute
> anything your user account can, steered by anyone you allowlist. Only allow
> people you'd hand your laptop to.

## How it works

```
┌──────────────┐     forum post/message      ┌──────────────────┐
│   Discord    │ ──────────────────────────► │    claudecord    │
│ #claude-     │                             │  (one Node proc) │
│  sessions    │ ◄────────────────────────── │                  │
└──────────────┘   text, 💭/⏺ feed, embeds   └────────┬─────────┘
                                                      │ streaming input
                                                      ▼
                                             ┌──────────────────┐
                                             │  Agent SDK query │
                                             │  (per post, in   │
                                             │   your workDir)  │
                                             └──────────────────┘
```

Each post owns a long-lived Agent SDK query in streaming-input mode. Discord messages
are pushed into it; every SDK event streams back out — thinking blocks and tool calls
into the activity feed, text blocks as messages, the per-turn result as the reaction
ack. The registry maps thread ↔ session so restarts and revivals resume seamlessly.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Bot online but ignores posts | Forum not configured — run `/setup`, then post in the forum it created |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN is not set` | Create the `.env` file next to `package.json` |
| Turn ends with ❌ and an auth error | Claude Code isn't logged in on this machine (`claude` in a terminal to check) — or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `/setup` fails | The bot is missing **Manage Channels** — re-invite with the URL above |
| Messages have no content server-side | **Message Content Intent** not enabled in the developer portal |
